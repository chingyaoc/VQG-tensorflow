# Visual Question Generation in Tensorflow
It's simple question generator based on visual content written in Tensorflow. The model is quite similar to GRNN in ***[Generating Natural Questions About an Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06059)*** but I use LSTM instead of GRU. It's quite similar to Google's new AI assistant [***Allo***](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fireball&hl=zh_HK) which can ask question based on image content. Since Mostafazadeh et al. does not released VQG dataset yet, we will use VQA dataset temporarily.

## Requirement
- Tensorflow, follow the [official installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup)
- python 2.7
- OpenCV
- VQA  dataset, go to the [dataset website](http://www.visualqa.org)

## Data
We will use VQA dataset which contains over 760K questions. We simply follow the steps in original [repo](https://github.com/VT-vision-lab/VQA_LSTM_CNN) to download the data and do some preprocessing. After running their code you
should acquire three files: ```data_prepro.h5```, ```data_prepro.json``` and ```data_img.h5```, put them in the root directory.

## Usage 
Train the VQG model:
```
python main.py --model_path=[where_to_save]
```
Demo VQG with single image: (you need to download pre-trained VGG19 [here](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg))
```
python main.py --is_train=False --test_image_path=[path_to_image] --test_model_path=[path_to_model]
```

We also let Allo reply to these images. Here's the result.

## TODO
Apply [VQG dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06059) instead of VQA to ask more useful question.
